        This app demonstrates how encrypting and decrypting data
        using a <b>SecretKey</b> that is retrieved from the <b>Android KeyStore</b>
        is 5 times slower on the <b>Google Pixel</b> device running Android Nougat
        as compared to other Android devices running Android Nougat or Android Marshmallow
        (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S7, LG Nexus 5X).

        Press the buttons below to encrypt and decrypt an array of 999 random bytes
        using \"AES/CBC/PKCS7PADDING\" encryption with a key of size 256 bits
        and an initialization vector of size 128 bits.
        You will observe that the encrypt and decrypt operations take 100+ milliseconds on a Google Pixel device
        but only ~20 milliseconds on other Android devices.
